## Introduction
Functional plant indicators can be used to describe the functional signature of plant communities by calculating community-weighted means of plant indicator values for plant communities (Diekmann 2003). The functional signature of plant communities may be indicative of ecosystem identity, depending on which functional plant indicator we look at (cf. Töpper et al. 2018). For instance, using an indicator for moisture one would find a functional signature with higher moisture values for plant communities in mires compared to e.g. grasslands or forests. Deviations in the functional signature of such an indicator beyond a certain range of indicator values (as there of course is natural variation of functional signatures within an ecosystem type) may be related to a reduction in ecological condition. Here, we combine functional plant indicator data with field sampled plant community data from the Norwegian nature monitoring program ANO (Tingstad et al. 2019) for semi-natural ecosystems. We calculate the functional signature of plant communities in the monitored sites with respect to light, moisture, pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, grazing_mowing, and soil disturbance. These functional signatures are then compared to reference distributions of functional signature, separately for each wetland ecosystem type, calculated from 'generalized species lists' underlying the Norwegian categorization system for eco-diversity (Halvorsen et al. 2020). These plant functional condition indicators are developed following the principles and technical protocol of the IBECA framework (Jakobsson et al. 2021, Töpper & Jakobsson 2021). Note that deviations from the reference may occur in both directions, e.g. the moisture signature from the testing data may be higher or lower than in the reference. Deviations in these two directions indicate very different environmental phenomena and thus have to be treated separately. Therefore, we develop two condition indicators for each functional plant indicator, a lower one and an upper one (see further down for more details).

## About the underlying data
In the 'functional plant indicator' project for semi-natural ecosystems, we use four sets of data for building indicators for ecological condition:

- as test data we use plant community data from (1) the ANO monitoring scheme (cf. Tingstad et al. 2019, contains semi-natural grasslands(T32), semi-natural wet meadows (V10), heathlands (T34), and we also decided to include near-semi-natural meadows (T41) ) and (2) from the ASO monitoring scheme (cf. Bär et al. 2021, targets semi-natural grasslands (T32) only)
- as reference data we use (3) generalized species lists from the Norwegian categorization system for eco-diversity (NiN) (cf. Halvorsen et al. 2020)
- (4) Swedish plant indicator data for light, moisture, pH, and nitrogen from Tyler et al. (2021)

(1) ANO monitoring data:
ANO stands for 'areal-representativ naturovervåking', i.e. 'area representative nature monitoring'. 1000 sites are randomly distributed across mainland Norway and visited within a 5-year cycle. Each ANO site spans a 500 x 500 m grid cell, and the data collection at each ANO site includes up to 12 evenly distributed vegetation analyses in 1 x 1 m plots (up to 12, because some of these evenly distributed points may be in water or otherwise inaccessible). For the vegetation analyses, the cover of each vascular plant species in the plot is recorded. Every vegetation analysis is accompanied by an assessment of the ecosystem the plot lies in, including ecosystem type and some additional variables related to ecosystem-specific drivers of state. In the analysis in this document, we only use the plots which were classified as one of the semi-natural ecosystem types in the Norwegian categorization system for eco-diversity (NiN).
In the analysis in this document, we use the data available on Miljødirektoratets kartkatalog (https://kartkatalog.miljodirektoratet.no/Dataset/Details/2054), which comprises data from the first three ANO-years, 2019-2021, and a total of 8887 plots in 498 sites.

(2) ASO monitoring data
ASO stands for 'arealrepresentativ overvåking av semi-naturlig eng', i.e. 'area representative monitoring of semi-natural meadows'. In ASO ca. 20 areas are chosen annually based on a probabilistic distribution model of semi-natural meadows in Norway (see Johansen et al. 2017 for details). Each ASO area (område) spans a 10 x 10 km grid cell, in which a maximum of up to 10 sites (flate) of 500 x 500 m are chosen. In each site, all semi-natural meadows (eng) with an area of at least 250 sqm are delineated. In up to three meadows per site the plant species composition is sampled using a transect method. For the vegetation transect analyses, both cover and frequency of each vascular plant species along the transect is recorded. For every meadow, the species data collection is accompanied by an assessment of the ecosystem, including ecosystem type and some additional variables related to ecosystem-specific drivers of state.
In the analysis in this document, we use the ASO data from 2022 only as the data from 2021 and the ASO pilot in 2019 are not in sufficiently good shape. In the future, all ASO data will hopefully be available in Miljødirektoratets kartkatalog.

(3) NiN reference data:
The generalized species lists underlying the ecosystem categorization in NiN represent expert-compiled species lists based on empirical evidence from the literature and expert knowledge of the systems and their species. In these lists, every species is assigned an abundance value on a 6-step scale, with each step representing a range for the 'expected combination of frequency and cover' of occurrence (1: < 1/32, 2: 1/32 - 1/8 , 3: 1/8 - 3/8, 4: 3/8 - 4/5, 5: 3/8 - 4/5 + dominance, 6: > 4/5). For the purpose of this project, these steps are simplified to maximum 'expected combination of frequency and cover', whereby steps 4 & 5 are assigned 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, in order to distinguish between them.

(4) The Swedish plant indicator set published by Tyler et al. (2021) contains a large collection of plant indicators based on the Swedish flora, which is well representative of the Norwegian flora as well. From this set, we decided to include indicator data for light, moisture, pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, grazing_mowing, and soil disturbance for semi-natural ecosystems as these are thought to be subject to potential change due to abandonment, drainage/flooding, pollution, and erosion.


### Representativity in time and space
For semi-natural ecosystems, the ANO data in this analysis contain 233 plots in 83 sites, in principle distributed randomly across the country. As semi-natural ecosystems occur more often in certain regions of Norway than in others, the amount of plots and sites is not equal among Norway's five regions. The 233 plots are distributed across regions in the following way:

- Northern Norway: ?
- Central Norway:  ?
- Eastern Norway:  ?
- Western Norway:  ?
- Southern Norway: ?

For ASO, this analysis covers 381 meadow transects in 96 sites.

The 381 transects are distributed across regions in the following way:

- Northern Norway: ?
- Central Norway:  ?
- Eastern Norway:  ?
- Western Norway:  ?
- Southern Norway: ?


### Temporal coverage
The ANO evaluation data cover the first three years, 2019-2021, of the first 5-year-cycle in the ANO monitoring scheme, as well as the 2022 ASO-data. Thus there is no actual time series to these data, and the indicator evaluation does therefore not include any temporal analyses.

## Reference state and values
### Reference state
The reference state is defined via the functional signature of the generalized species lists in NiN (see also Töpper et al. 2018). By bootstrapping the species lists (see details further below) and calculating community-weighted means of functional plant indicators for every re-sampled community, we describe the reference state as a distribution of indicator values for each respective plant functional indicator. These distributions are calculated for ecosystem sub-types ("grunntyper" or "kartleggingsenheter" at a 1:5000 mapping scale) within the main wetland types in NiN. A more extensive discussion on the use of reference communities can be found in Jakobsson et al. (2020).


### Reference values, thresholds for defining _good ecological condition_, minimum and/or maximum values
In this analysis, we derive scaling values from statistical (here, non-parametric) distributions (see Jakobsson et al. 2010). For each ecosystem sub-type and plant functional indicator, the reference value is defined as the median value of the indicator value distribution. As in most cases the distributions naturally are two-sided (but see the Heat-requirement indicator in the mountain assessment for an example of a one-sided functional plant indicator, Fremstad et al. 2022), and deviation from the optimal state thus may occur in both direction (e.g. indicating too low or too high pH), we need to define two threshold values for good ecological condition as well as both a minimum and maximum value. In line with previous assessments of ecological condition for Norwegian forests and mountains, we define a lower and an upper threshold value via the 95% confidence interval of the reference distribution, i.e. its 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles. The minimum and maximum values are given by the minimum and maximum of the possible indicator values for each respective plant functional indicator. For details on the scaling principles in IBECA, please see Töpper & Jakobsson (2021).


## Uncertainties
We can calculate a mean indicator value (after scaling) for every region (or any other delimited area of interest) as well as its corresponding standard error and standard deviation as a measure of spatial uncertainty for a geographical area.

For each ecosystem type with a NiN species list, we can calculate a community weighted mean (CWM) for the relevant functional plant indicators.
For semi-natural ecosystems, we are testing "Light", "Moisture", "Soil_reaction_pH", "Nitrogen", "Phosphorus", "Grazing_mowing", and "Soil_disturbance". In order to get distributions of CWMs rather than one single value (for comparison with the empirical testing data) the NiN lists can be bootstrapped.

##### bootstrap function for frequency abundance
- function to calculate community weighted means of selected indicator values (ind)
- for species lists (sp) with given abundances in percent (or on a scale from 0 to 1) in one or more 'sites' (abun)
- with a given number of iterations (iter),
- with species given a certain minimum abundance occurring in all bootstraps (obl), and
- with a given re-sampling ratio of the original species list (rat)
- in every bootstrap iteration the abundance of the sampled species can be randomly changed by a limited amount if wished by introducing a re-sampling of abundance values from adjacent abundance steps with a certain probability (var.abun)

```{r, echo = F}

Running the bootstraps

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
colnames(NiN.seminat)
# 1st column is the species
# 2nd-35th column is the abundances of sp in different ecosystem types
# 36th-42nd column is the indicator values of the respective species
# we choose 1000 iterations
# species with abundance 1 (i.e. a max of 100%, must be included in each sample)
# each sample re-samples 1/3 of the number of species
# the abundance of the re-sampled species may vary (see bootstrap function for details)
seminat.ref.cov <- indBoot.freq(sp=NiN.seminat.cov[,1],abun=NiN.seminat.cov[,2:35],ind=NiN.seminat.cov[,36:42],
                                iter=1000,obl=1,rat=1/3,var.abun=T)

# fixing NaNs
for (i in 1:length(seminat.ref.cov) ) {
  for (j in 1:ncol(seminat.ref.cov[[i]]) ) {
    v <- seminat.ref.cov[[i]][,j]
    v[is.nan(v)] <- NA
    seminat.ref.cov[[i]][,j] <- v
  }
}
```

```{r, include = F}
load("/data/P-Prosjekter2/41201785_okologisk_tilstand_2022_2023/data/FPI_output large files for markdown/ref_lists_seminat.RData")
```

```{r}
head(seminat.ref.cov[[1]])
```

This results in an R-list with a slot for every selected indicator, and in every slot there's a data frame with as many columns as there are NiN species lists and as many rows as there were iterations in the bootstrap.
Next, we need to derive scaling values from these bootstrap-lists (the columns) for every mapping unit in NiN. Here, we define things in the following way:

- Median = reference values
- 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles = lower and upper limit values
- min and max of the respective indicator's scale = min/max values

```{r, echo = F}

# every NiN-type is represented by one 'generalisert artsliste'
# some NiN-types are represented by two such species lists
# in some cases two NiN-types are represented by the same species list

Once test data (ANO) and the scaling values from the reference data (NiN) are in place, we can calculate CWMs of the selected indicators for the ANO community data and scale them against the scaling values from the reference distribution. Note that we scale each ANO plot's CWM against either the lower threshold value and the min value OR the upper threshold value and the max value based on whether the CWM is smaller or higher than the reference value. Since the scaled values for both sides range between 0 and 1, we generate separate lower and upper condition indicators for each  functional plant indicator. An ANO plot can only have a scaled value in either the lower or the upper indicator (the other one will be 'NA'), except for the unlikely event that the CWM exactly matches the reference value, in which case both lower and upper indicator will receive a scaled indicator value of 1.

Here is the scaling function
```{r}

#### scaled values ####
r.s <- 1    # reference value
l.s <- 0.6  # limit value
a.s <- 0    # abscence of indicator, or indicator at maximum

#### function for calculating scaled values for measured value ####

## scaling function including truncation
scal <- function() {
  # place to hold the result
   x <- numeric()
  if (maxmin < ref) {
    # values >= the reference value equal 1
    if (val >= ref) {x <- 1}
    # values < the reference value and >= the limit value can be deducted from the linear relationship between these two
    if (val < ref & val >= lim) {x <- (l.s + (val-lim) * ( (r.s-l.s) / (ref-lim) ) )}
    # values < the limit value and > maxmin can be deducted from the linear relationship between these two
    if (val < lim & val > maxmin) {x <- (a.s + (val-maxmin) * ( (l.s-a.s) / (lim-maxmin) ) )}
    # value equals or lower than maxmin
    if (val <= maxmin) {x <-0}
  } else {
    # values <= the reference value equal 1
    if (val <= ref) {x <- 1}
    # values > the reference value and <= the limit value can be deducted from the linear relationship between these two
    if (val > ref & val <= lim) {x <- ( r.s - ( (r.s - l.s) * (val - ref) / (lim - ref) ) )}
    # values > the limit value and < maxmin can be deducted from the linear relationship between these two
    if (val > lim) {x <- ( l.s - (l.s * (val - lim) / (maxmin - lim) ) )}
    # value equals or larger than maxmin
    if (val >= maxmin) {x <-0}
  }
  return(x)
  
}

```

We then can prepare a list of data frames to hold the results and perform the scaling according to the principles described in NINA report 1967 (Töpper and Jakobsson 2021)

```
The ANO results show that especially some T32s (semi-natural meadows) have reduced light, grazing_mowing, and soil_disturbance values, which indicates abandonment. In addition, the results indicate too acidic conditions in some plant communities. The ASO results show similar outcomes with respect to abandonment and acidity, but in addition also deviations towards too high nitrogen values.


### Indicator index maps
We can also show the results as a map, for instance for Grazing_mowing1 (the lower Grazing_mowing indicator), either by directly plotting the data onto the map...

### unscaled values vs. reference
We can also compare the unscaled values to the reference distribution in order to identify ecosystem types and functional plant indicators showing a deviation from the expectation. Since Grazing_mowing for ANO and nitrogen for ASO show some deviations  we exemplify this with these indicators for unscaled values.

Grazing_mowing, ANO:
