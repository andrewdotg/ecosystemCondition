## Environmental space

-   Extract environmental data from the polygons and compare against reference data points.
-   Uni-variate (e.g. *boreal hei* plotted against elevation, oceanity, distance from roads, etc)

## Represntaivity in mapping units

Only a subset of nature types are mapped. How well do the mapped units represent, or cover, the range of nature types that is included for each main ecosystem group?

## Conclution 1

Conclude about which main ecosystem types that can reliably assess using the available mapping units?

What about suitability for defining reference values?

## Suitability

In the subset of mapping units that can be said to represent an ecosystem group, which NiN or MdirPRAM variables should we use?

## Concrete examples

### Andel lynghei med minst to faser i kystlynghei

### Areal uten skadet og/eller død røsslyng i kystlynghei

### Aktuell bruksintensitet
